# Open Source Learning
This folder is created to add open source related learning materials

//Thanks to https://indiafoss.net/2023 by FOSS India asking for a valid link! 
Hence, I added a basic introduction set of slides on open source basics and 
the course I introduced in one of the colleges in Bangalore. 
This is to start with. Will add more useful stuff going forward :)
